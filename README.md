# OrcaUI (dev) ðŸš§

This project is the UI representation of our [OrcaBus project](https://github.com/umccr/orcabus).

Currently, this project is still in development.

## Development

### API Types Generator

We utilize [OpenAPI Typescript](https://openapi-ts.dev/) to generate TypeScript types from the OpenAPI schema. To generate new types or update existing ones, run the following command:

```sh
make generate-openapi-types
```

## Running Frontend locally

Prerequisite

- Node.js with Yarn
- Docker (for API run locally)
- Active AWS SSO login session (e.g. `aws sso login --profile dev && export AWS_PROFILE=dev`)

```sh
$ node --version
v20.15.0

#  run 'corepack enable' to activate corepack
$ corepack -v
0.20.0
```

Install the dependencies (precommit will be installed)

```sh
$ make install

$ pre-commit --version
pre-commit 3.7.0
```

Start Front-end Development Server

```sh
make start
```
